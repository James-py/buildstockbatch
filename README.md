# BuildStock Batch

This set of tools provides an alternative means to PAT to run and manage the batch
simulations for the
[OpenStudio-BuildStock](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio-BuildStock)
building stock energy modeling platform. It can be used to run the
simulations locally, on Amazon Web Services (coming soon), or on NREL's
supercomputers.

For information how to run the simulations please read the [documentation](http://buildstock-batch.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).
